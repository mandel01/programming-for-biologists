# Programming for Biologists

<img src="images/pfb-logo.png" alt="Programming for Biologists Logo" width="400" align="center">

The group is focused at the Northwestern University Chicago Campus and is open to all members of the Northwestern community. The goals of the group are:

1. Introduce skills for researchers to conduct basic manipulations, run published software, and begin to write software themselves.
2. To serve as a networking opportunity and launch pad for additional training and research collaboration.

To achieve these goals, the group runs workshops, maintains a user group, and will begin to put together more advanced groups.

The activities of the group are made possible with strong support from [Research Computing](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/).

## Branding

Some ninja Googling has revealed that this fairly generic name "Programming for Biologists" is already in use in [Ethan White's Programming for Biologists Curriculum](http://www.programmingforbiologists.org). To avoid any confusion a goal for Spring 2016 will be to rebrand this group as something Northwestern-specific. Names & logo ideas are welcome!
