# Programming for Biologists

<img src="images/pfb-logo.png" alt="Programming for Biologists Logo" width="400" align="center">

The group is focused at the Northwestern University Chicago Campus and is open to all members of the Northwestern community. The goals of the group are:

1. Introduce skills for researchers to conduct basic manipulations, run published software, and begin to write software themselves.
2. To serve as a networking opportunity and launch pad for additional training and research collaboration.

To achieve these goals, the group runs workshops and foster regular users group meetings.

## User Group

In Fall 2015 a group met following the command line workshop, and in Winter/Spring 2016 a group from the Software Carpentry course met informally to follow up on Python material. In Fall 2016 we will look to assemble a Python-focused group of Chicago campus users.

## Listserv

To join the listserv send a message to `listserv@listserv.it.northwestern.edu` with the following in the body (not subject) of the message, filled in with your information:

## Branding

Some ninja Googling has revealed that this fairly generic name "Programming for Biologists" is already in use in [Ethan White's Programming for Biologists Curriculum](http://www.programmingforbiologists.org). To be clear, we are not affiliated with him -- but upon finding his site it looks fantastic and people should definitely check it out and support it! Ethan has generously permitted us to continue to use the name, but in the future it would be good to have unique, Northwestern-specific branding for our group. Names & logo ideas are welcome!
