# Programming for Biologists workshop series at Northwestern University Chicago Campus

All members of the Northwestern community are welcome to attend the user group and workshops presented. The goals of the group are two-fold:

1. Introduce skills for researchers to conduct basic manipulations, run published software, and begin to write software themselves.
2. To serve as a networking opportunity and launch pad for additional training and research collaboration.

To achieve these goals, the group runs workshops, maintains a user group, and will begin to put together more advanced groups.

The activities of the group are made possible with strong support from [Research Computing](http://www.it.northwestern.edu/research/).
